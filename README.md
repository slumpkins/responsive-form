Responsive Contact Form  
===============

Added CSS to make form responsive. Max-width is 640px, no min-width adapted from:
http://ftutorials.com/responsive-html5-and-php-contact-form/

Removed table container, so hopefully any other js or whatever will still be able to call it, no html was altered besides table container.

CSS Shouldn't affect master document

Should test.
